# Puppet

- `puppet apply /path/to/manifests` works, or you can specify a .pp file

## Examples

### Show variables about the host that puppet knows (facts)

```
facter
```

### Show how puppet interacts with a resource

```
puppet describe cron
```

### Show available puppet types

```
puppet resource --types
```

### Show the puppet code that will create a resource

```
$ puppet resource file /etc/hosts
file { '/etc/hosts':
  ensure  => 'file',
  content => '{md5}9ffbd726fd5b15de760cc0150d607628',
  ctime   => 'Wed Apr 01 17:05:59 -0700 2015',
  group   => '0',
  mode    => '644',
  mtime   => 'Wed Apr 01 17:05:59 -0700 2015',
  owner   => '0',
  type    => 'file',
}
```

# Marionette Collective

"The Marionette Collective, also known as MCollective, is a framework for building server orchestration or parallel job-execution systems. Most users programmatically execute administrative tasks on clusters of servers." - <http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/>

* Cheatsheet: https://coderwall.com/p/ig9mxa/mcollective-mco-cheat-sheet

## mco

### Find a random node in the cluster

```
mco find -1
```

### Ping all nodes in the puppet cluster

```
mco ping
```

### Show stats about which OSes you have

```
mco facts lsbdistdescription
```

### Find machines that have a certain fact

```
mco find --with-fact lsbdistcodename=lucid
```

### Show a fact on machines that have a specific fact

```
mco facts role --with-fact lsbdistcodename=lucid -v
```

### Show detailed info about a node

```
mco inventory fqdn.example.com
```

### Find nodes with certain facts

```
mco find --with-fact lsbdistdescription="Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS"
```

### Find nodes that match a config management class

```
mco find -C role::awsadmin
```

### Show the classes for a given host

```
sort /var/lib/puppet/state/classes.txt
```

### Show the status and puppet policy about a package on all hosts

```
mco rpc package status package=openssh-client --discovery-timeout 60 --json
```

### Show breakdown of hosts by OS version by role

```
mco facts -v --wc role::mon lsbdistdescription
```

## Use mco to find packages of a certain version on a certain OS

```
mco rpc package status package=apt -j -F lsbdistcodename=trusty > cache.json
cat cache.json | jq -c '.[] | select(.data.ensure == "1.0.1ubuntu2") | { version: .data.ensure, hostname: .sender }'
```
