Title: atop

"Atop is an ASCII full-screen performance monitor for Linux that is capable of reporting the activity of all processes (even if processes have finished during the interval), daily logging of system and process activity for long-term analysis, highlighting overloaded system resources by using colors, etc." - <https://www.atoptool.nl/>

The feature that sets atop apart from other process `top` tools is that it catches short-lived processes that would be left out of period sampling that other tools use.
